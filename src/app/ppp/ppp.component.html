    <p class="lead white-text text-indent">The Plastic Pollution Project is a student group that was born in spring 2018. It was founded by Professor Alison Lipman who teaches ecology at UCLA and is the co-founder of SELVA international. Due to the immense amount of plastic in the oceans, PPP decided to take action to stop the flow of plastics coming from UCLA. Ultimately, the team aims to both curb the amount of single use plastics that are sent to our landfills and oceans as well as create a reusable culture among the students on campus. They hope to achieve this goal by education and political activism, working with the university to take on effective new policies.</p>
